# 👋 Hello, I'm Kim Dongheon.

### I became a <u>developer</u> to bring to life what I had always imagined.
### Now, I'm an <u>entrepreneur</u> who turns everyone's imagination into reality.

I am currently studying blockchain.

- 🏃🏻 I appreciate <u>Lean</u> principles and have improved four projects in three months, always attentive to user feedback.
- 💬 I consider <u>feedback</u> to be crucial and was the first to introduce a feedback culture within the team.
- 🏢 While working at my job, <u>I review other people's code</u> and apply what I learn to my entrepreneurial endeavors.
- 📝 At the end of each day, I always make it a point to <u>write down</u> what I've learned.
- 🌕 My hobbies include <u>stargazing</u>, <u>brewing coffee</u>, and <u>hosting book club meetings</u>.
